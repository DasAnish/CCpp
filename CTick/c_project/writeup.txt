- server.c
This sets up a server with a maximum of 5 connections and a buffer size of 1024 bytes. 
It accepts two parameters,  a server port and the name of the file to be transmitted.
It first constructs a name in the "server" sockaddr_in struct and zeroes out the structure.
This initialises the structure and mitigates issues related to non-initialised data.
This socket is meant to be in the local machine, and is initialised to be a IPv4 socket, and listens
to any IP address the computer has, not just localhost. It is a stream socket that communicates using TCP.
A stream socket provides bidirectional, reliable, sequenced, and unduplicated flow of data.
A socket is created with no name, and so a name has to be bound to it. The "server" name 
is bound to the socket. We specify it to listen to only MAXOPEN number of connections.
Then we accept a connection from client. Then, it reads bytes from the file, each time of size BUFSIZE,
and sends it to the connected client. Then it resets the file pointer to the top of the file.

- client.c
Creates a socket that uses TCP protocol and IPv4 and connects that socket to the server address. It then
reads data of size BUFSIZE from the connection, and prints it out to stdout.
